# Labrom optical flow

This package contains our implementation of continuous homography optical flow for a image sensor. The method is described in [1-2]. The method relies on the underlying assumption that there is a dominant plane in the scene. Camera velocity is extracted from the homography matrix, which is computed from the de-rotated optical flow. Angular velocities must be provided by an external sensor (gyro).

The method has been succeffully evaluated on different quadrotors using a downward looking camera: AscTec Pelican equipped with a rolling shutter Philips webcam (0.3 MP @ 20 frames/s ) and Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.0 equipped with a camera combo FX798T (0.3 MP @ 20 frame/s). Some of these experiments are discussed in [3].
